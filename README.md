# fen.sh

**WARNING! BAD SCRIPT INCOMING**

Fen.sh is the script I use to generate images of chessboards for my website.
Pass the script a standard FEN string and it will generate a *-result.png.
Despite this cool function it's a crappy script that I hacked together in an
afternoon, and I strongly don't recommend using it!
