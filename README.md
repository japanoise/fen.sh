# fen.sh

**WARNING! BAD SCRIPT INCOMING**

Fen.sh is the script I use to generate images of chessboards for my website.
Pass the script a standard FEN string and it will generate a *-result.png.
Despite this cool function it's a crappy script that I hacked together in an
afternoon, and I strongly don't recommend using it!

Default theme, cburnett, is copyright Colin M.L. Burnett and licensed under a

GFDL. I think it's safe to assume CC-BY-SA as it was likely relicensed (my
source for these images is Wikimedia)
